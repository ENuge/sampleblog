Sample code for my website. Some things are changed a bit, but this is the general layout.

I could probably do with cleaning up the code a little bit. Also, there are a couple of cache/database related retrieval that should be handled better, but I haven't gotten around to fixing just yet. The code is fully functional, however. I have the related HTML pages, but I'm not sharing the design fully. If you want, you can venture over to http://enugent93.appspot.com and view source to get much of that--I don't claim to be an expert at markup, caveat emptor etc etc...
